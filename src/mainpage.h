    \section intro Introduction
    This package consists of a class library and an application. The
    library contains abstractions which facilitate combining information
    from 1) the spacecraft pointing file, 2) a spectrum, and 3)
    instrument response functions from the latResponse package to
    produce an integrated, total instrument response in a format
    acceptable to Xspec.
